# Graph traversal

## Depth-first search (DFS)
Begins at a starting node, and proceeds to all other nodes that are
reachable from the starting node using the edges of the graph. 

Keeps track of visited nodes,so that it processes each node only once.

Time complexity: O(n+ m) where n is the number
of nodes and m is the number of edges,
